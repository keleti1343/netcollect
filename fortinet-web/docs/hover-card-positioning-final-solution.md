# Hover Card Positioning - Final Solution

## Problem Description
The hover card for the "VDOM NAME" column in the VIPs page was appearing off-screen, making it impossible for users to view the firewall details when hovering over VDOM names.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by:
1. **Right-edge anchoring**: The hover card was positioned with `right-0`, anchoring it to the right edge of the cell
2. **Viewport overflow**: When the table cell was near the right edge of the viewport, the hover card extended beyond the visible area
3. **Insufficient positioning control**: Simple CSS positioning classes weren't providing enough flexibility for dynamic positioning

## Final Solution Implementation

### Step 1: Enhanced Z-Index Stacking
**File**: `fortinet-web/app/vips/page.tsx` (Line 290)

**Before**:
```tsx
<TableCell className="relative group cursor-help hover:bg-[var(--hover-trigger-bg-hover)] transition-[var(--hover-trigger-transition)]">
```

**After**:
```tsx
<TableCell className="relative group cursor-help hover:bg-[var(--hover-trigger-bg-hover)] transition-[var(--hover-trigger-transition)] z-10">
```

**Purpose**: Added `z-10` to ensure the hover card appears above other table elements and maintains proper stacking context.

### Step 2: Transform-Based Positioning
**File**: `fortinet-web/app/vips/page.tsx` (Lines 296-302)

**Before**:
```tsx
<div
  className="absolute z-[9999] hidden group-hover:block hover:block right-0 top-full mt-1 w-64 sm:w-80 md:w-96 rounded-lg border border-border bg-popover shadow-lg overflow-hidden"
  style={{ maxHeight: 'calc(80vh - 100px)', overflowY: 'auto' }}
>
```

**After**:
```tsx
<div
  className="absolute z-[9999] hidden group-hover:block hover:block top-full mt-1 w-64 sm:w-80 md:w-96 rounded-lg border border-border bg-popover shadow-lg overflow-hidden"
  style={{ 
    maxHeight: 'calc(80vh - 100px)', 
    overflowY: 'auto',
    left: '0',
    transform: 'translateX(-25%)'
  }}
>
```

**Key Changes**:
- **Removed**: `right-0` class (was anchoring to right edge)
- **Added**: `left: '0'` in style (anchors to left edge of cell)
- **Added**: `transform: 'translateX(-25%)'` (shifts card leftward by 25% of its width)

## How the Solution Works

### Positioning Logic
1. **Base Position**: `left: '0'` positions the hover card's left edge at the left edge of the table cell
2. **Transform Shift**: `translateX(-25%)` moves the card leftward by 25% of its own width
3. **Result**: The hover card is positioned with its left quarter extending beyond the cell's left edge, and its right three-quarters extending to the right

### Visual Representation
```
Table Cell:     [    VDOM NAME    ]
Hover Card:  [--------Hover Card Content--------]
             ↑                                  ↑
        25% extends left                   75% extends right
```

### Responsive Behavior
- **Small screens** (`w-64`): Card width = 256px, leftward shift = 64px
- **Medium screens** (`sm:w-80`): Card width = 320px, leftward shift = 80px  
- **Large screens** (`md:w-96`): Card width = 384px, leftward shift = 96px

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Viewport Awareness**: The card is less likely to extend beyond the right edge of the viewport
2. **Consistent Positioning**: Works across different screen sizes due to percentage-based transform
3. **Maintains Hover State**: The invisible bridge area ensures smooth hover interactions
4. **Proper Stacking**: Enhanced z-index prevents overlap issues with other elements
5. **Scrollable Content**: Maintains vertical scrolling for long content with `maxHeight` constraint

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Hover card appears fully visible on desktop screens
- [ ] Hover card positioning works on mobile/tablet viewports
- [ ] Hover state is maintained when moving cursor over the card
- [ ] Card content is scrollable when it exceeds maximum height
- [ ] No overlap with other table elements or UI components
- [ ] Smooth transitions when hovering in/out

## Alternative Solutions (If Issues Persist)

If the current solution doesn't fully resolve the issue, consider these alternatives:

### Option 1: Dynamic Positioning with JavaScript
Implement a custom hook to detect viewport boundaries and adjust positioning dynamically.

### Option 2: Positioning Library
Use a library like Floating UI or Popper.js for advanced positioning logic.

### Option 3: Modal-Based Approach
Convert hover cards to click-triggered modals for better mobile experience.

## Maintenance Notes

- The `translateX(-25%)` value can be adjusted if different positioning is needed
- Monitor user feedback to ensure the positioning feels natural
- Consider implementing viewport detection for even more precise positioning in future iterations
